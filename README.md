# Self Project

Python | Data Science | Machine Learning | Natural Language Processing 

The project aims to develop an ML model for sentiment analysis to classify text data into categories (eg: positive/negative/neutral). Using statistical techniques by leveraging Python libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib. This is learnt and done in 1_Python_Basics

First, I will preprocess and analyze the dataset to extract meaningful features. Then, I will apply various machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Clustering, etc to train and evaluate the model's performance on various parameters. I have learnt this well and it is implemented in the 2nd code file 2_ML_Sentiment_Analysis.

The final model provides insights into the general sentiment of text-based datasets, which could be applied in fields like customer feedback analysis, customer segmentation, disease prediction or social media monitoring etc.
